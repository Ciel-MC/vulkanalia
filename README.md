Released under the Apache License 2.0.

## Example

See the `examples` directory for an implementation of the classic triangle example using `vulkanalia`.

## Tutorial

For users new to Vulkan, there is an adaptation of https://vulkan-tutorial.com to use Rust and `vulkanalia` instead of C++. The published version of this tutorial can be found [here](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia) and the sources for the tutorial (including standalone working code examples for each chapter) are in this repository in the `tutorial` directory.

For users already familiar with Vulkan who just want to know how `vulkanalia` allows calling the Vulkan API from Rust, see the `API Concepts` section of the `Overview` chapter of the aforementioned tutorial which can be found [here](https://kylemayes.github.io/vulkanalia/overview.html#api-concepts).
